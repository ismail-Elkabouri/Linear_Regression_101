## Introduction

Linear regression is one of the most basic and widely used statistical techniques for predictive modeling. It is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Classification, on the other hand, is a supervised learning technique used to categorize data into different classes.

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the implementation of linear regression and classification algorithms from scratch. The notebooks are based on the teachings of **Andrew Ng** from his **DeepLearning.AI** course, which is one of the most popular and comprehensive courses on machine learning.

## Installation

To run the notebooks locally, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ismail-Elkabouri/Linear_Regression_Classification_101.git
   cd Linear_Regression_Classification_101/01_Linear_Regression_Labs
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but Recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
